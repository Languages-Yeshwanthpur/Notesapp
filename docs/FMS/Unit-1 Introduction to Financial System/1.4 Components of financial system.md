# Components of the Formal Financial System

The formal financial system comprises four key components, each playing a crucial role in the efficient functioning of financial activities. These components are:

## 1. Financial Institutions

**Definition:** Financial institutions are intermediaries responsible for mobilizing savings and facilitating the allocation of funds efficiently.

**Classification:**
- **Banking Institutions:** These institutions create and provide credit. Banks' liabilities are part of the money supply.
- **Non-banking Financial Institutions:** These institutions also provide credit but may not contribute to the money supply. Examples in India include Developmental Financial Institutions (DFIs), Non-banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs).
- **Specialized Finance Institutions:** Such as the Export Import Bank of India (EXIM), Tourism Finance Corporation of India (TFCI), and Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC).
- **Investment Institutions:** Mutual funds (e.g., Unit Trust of India), public and private sector mutual funds, and insurance companies like Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and General Insurance Corporation (GIC).

## 2. Financial Markets

**Definition:** Financial markets are mechanisms where participants engage in trading financial claims, setting prices for these claims based on demand and supply.

**Classification:**
- **Money Market:** Deals with short-term securities.
- **Capital Market:** Involves long-term securities with a maturity period of one year or more.
- **Primary Market:** Handles new securities issuance.
- **Secondary Market:** Facilitates trading in existing securities. It includes Over-the-Counter (OTC) and exchange-traded markets, with the latter also including the derivatives market.

## 3. Financial Instruments

**Definition:** Financial instruments represent claims for future payments or periodic interest/dividend. These instruments include shares, bonds, and notes, denominated in small amounts and traded in organized markets.

**Classification:**
- **Primary Securities:** Directly issued by borrowers to savers, e.g., equity shares and debentures.
- **Secondary Securities:** Issued by financial intermediaries to savers, e.g., bank deposits, mutual fund units, and insurance policies.

## 4. Financial Services

**Definition:** Financial services encompass various functions such as borrowing, lending, investing, payments, settlements, and risk management in financial markets.

**Categories:**
- **Funds Intermediation:** Links savers and borrowers, promoting capital formation.
- **Payments Mechanism:** Ensures quick, safe, and convenient fund transfers.
- **Provision of Liquidity:** Enhances financial claims' liquidity, aided by brokers and market makers.
- **Risk Management:** Helps participants transfer and protect against various risks.
- **Financial Engineering:** Involves designing innovative solutions for funding, investing, and risk management, e.g., asset restructuring and synthetic securities.

Financial intermediaries, including banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and stock exchanges, provide these services, bridging the gap between investor knowledge and the complex financial instrument landscape. Regulatory bodies like the RBI and SEBI oversee and regulate these components to protect investor interests and maintain market integrity, fostering the growth and development of the financial system.
