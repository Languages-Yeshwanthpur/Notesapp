# Evolution of the Indian Financial System

The evolution of the Indian financial system can be understood through the lens of economic development and the growth of financial institutions. This concept is influenced by the work of Gurley and Shaw (1955, 1960, 1967) and Goldsmith (1969), who discussed the stages in the evolution of financial systems. According to their framework, there is a correlation between per capita income and the development of a financial system.

In the early stages of economic development, typically characterized by low per capita income, most investments are self-financed, and financial intermediaries are scarce. This scarcity is due to the high costs associated with financial intermediation, which outweigh the benefits at this stage.

As a country undergoes development and per capita income rises, bilateral borrowing and lending activities begin to emerge. This marks the birth of financial intermediaries, which facilitate the flow of funds between savers and borrowers. With further increases in per capita income, the number and significance of financial intermediaries tend to grow.

Among these financial intermediaries, banks often take a prominent role in facilitating financial investments. They play a crucial role in channeling funds from savers to borrowers and supporting economic expansion.

However, as countries continue to advance economically, non-bank financial intermediaries and stock markets also expand in size and become more active and efficient compared to banks. This diversification of the financial system reflects a broader trend of financial systems becoming more market-oriented as countries become wealthier.

In the context of India, this evolution has seen the gradual development and diversification of its financial system, with banks, non-bank financial institutions, and stock markets all playing vital roles in supporting the country's economic growth and development.
