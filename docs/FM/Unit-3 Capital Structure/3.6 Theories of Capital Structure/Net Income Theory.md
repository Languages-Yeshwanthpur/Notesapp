# 1. Net Income (NI) Approach

David Durand suggested two famous capital structure theories: the Net Income Approach and the Operating Income Approach.

According to the NI approach, a firm can increase its total value by lowering its cost of capital. The point at which the cost of capital is lowest and the value of the firm is greatest is considered the optimum capital structure. At this point, the market price per share is maximized.

This can be achieved by continuously lowering the cost of capital through the use of debt capital. In other words, using more debt capital while reducing the cost of capital will increase the value of the firm.

This is possible only when:

i. Cost of Debt (Kd) is less than Cost of Equity (Ke).

ii. There are no taxes.

iii. The use of debt does not change the risk perception of the investors since the degree of leverage is increased to that extent.

As the amount of debt in the capital structure increases, the weighted average cost of capital decreases, leading to an increase in the total value of the firm. So, increasing the amount of debt while keeping the cost of equity and cost of debt constant will enhance the earnings of the shareholders.

**Illustration:**

X Ltd. presents the following particulars:

- EBIT (Net Operating Income): Rs. 30,000
- Equity capitalization ratio (Cost of Equity): 15% (Ke)
- Cost of debt: 10% (Kd)
- Total Capital: Rs. 2,00,000

**Calculate the cost of capital and the value of the firm for each of the following alternative leverage ratios after applying the NI approach:**

- Leverage (Debt to Total Capital): 0%, 20%, 50%, 70%, and 100%

**Statement Showing the Cost of Capital and the Value of the Firm**

**Workings:**

**Average Cost of Capital** is computed as follows (under various financing plans):

From the above table, it is clear that the value of the firm (V) will increase if there is a proportionate increase in debt capital, leading to a reduction in the overall cost of capital. Therefore, the cost of capital is minimized, and the value of the firm is maximized if a firm uses 100% debt capital.

It is interesting to note that the NI approach can also be graphically presented as follows (with the help of the above illustration):

The degree of leverage is plotted along the X-axis, while Ke, Kw, and Kd are on the Y-axis. It reveals that when cheaper debt capital in the capital structure is proportionally increased, the weighted average cost of capital (Kw) decreases, as does the cost of debt (Kd). Thus, the optimal capital structure minimizes the cost of capital and maximizes the value of the firm.

The total market value of a firm based on the Net Income Approach can be ascertained as follows:

```
V = S + D
```

Where:
V = Total market value of a firm
S = Market value of equity shares = Earnings Available to Equity Shareholders (NI) / Equity Capitalization Rate
D = Market value of debt
```

The Overall Cost of Capital or Weighted Average Cost of Capital can be calculated as:

```
K_{o}= 
```

**Illustration:**

X Ltd. is expecting an annual EBIT of Rs. 1 lakh. The company has Rs. 4 lakhs in 10% debentures. The cost of equity capital or capitalization rate is 12.5%. You are required to calculate the total value of the firm according to the Net Income Approach.

**Solution:**

**Calculation of the Value of the Firm**

1. Net Income (EBIT)

```
Net Income (EBIT) = Rs. 1,00,000
```

2. Less: Interest on Debentures of Rs. 4,00,000

```
Earnings available to equity shareholders = Rs. 1,00,000 - Rs. 60,000 = Rs. 40,000
```

3. Market Capitalization Rate = 12.5%

4. Market Value of Equity (S)

```
Market Value of Equity (S) = (Earnings available to equity shareholders / Market Capitalization Rate) * 100
Market Value of Equity (S) = (Rs. 40,000 / 0.125) * 100 = Rs. 32,00,000
```

5. Market Value of Debentures (D)

```
Market Value of Debentures (D) = Rs. 4,00,000
```

6. Value of the Firm (S + D)

```
Value of the Firm (S + D) = Rs. 32,00,000 + Rs. 4,00,000 = Rs. 36,00,000
```

So, the total value of the firm according to the Net Income Approach is Rs. 36,00,000.
