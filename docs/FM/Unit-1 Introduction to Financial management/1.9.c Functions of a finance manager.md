# Functions of a Financial Manager

## 1. Estimating the Amount of Capital Required

The primary function of a financial manager is to estimate the amount of capital required by the business. Businesses need capital for purchasing fixed assets, meeting working capital requirements, and modernizing and expanding their operations. The financial manager makes estimates for both short-term and long-term capital needs.

## 2. Determining Capital Structure

Once the capital requirements have been determined, the financial manager needs to decide on the appropriate capital structure. This involves determining the right mix of equity and debt, as well as the ratio of short-term to long-term debt. The goal is to achieve the lowest cost of capital and maximize shareholders' wealth.

## 3. Choice of Sources of Funds

Before procuring funds, the finance manager must decide on the sources from which funds will be raised. Funds can be raised from various sources, including equity shareholders, preference shareholders, debenture holders, banks, financial institutions, public deposits, and more.

## 4. Procurement of Funds

The financial manager takes steps to procure the funds required for the business. This may involve negotiations with creditors, financial institutions, or issuing a prospectus, among other methods. The procurement of funds depends on factors such as the cost of raising funds, market conditions, investor preferences, and government policies.

## 5. Utilisation of Funds

Funds procured by the financial manager need to be prudently invested in various assets to maximize returns on investment. Investment decisions should be guided by principles of safety, profitability, and liquidity.

## 6. Disposal of Profits or Surplus

The financial manager must decide how much profit to retain for reinvestment and how much to distribute as dividends to shareholders. Factors influencing these decisions include the company's earnings trend, market share price trend, funding requirements for future programs, and more.

## 7. Management of Cash

Managing cash and other current assets is a crucial task for the financial manager. It involves forecasting cash inflows and outflows to ensure there is neither a shortage nor surplus of cash within the firm. Adequate funds must be available for purchasing materials, paying wages, and covering day-to-day expenses.

## 8. Financial Control

Financial performance evaluation is another important function of the financial manager. The primary measure of evaluation is Return on Investment (ROI). Other techniques for financial control and evaluation include budgetary control, cost control, internal audit, break-even analysis, and ratio analysis. Financial planning also plays a critical role in these functions.
