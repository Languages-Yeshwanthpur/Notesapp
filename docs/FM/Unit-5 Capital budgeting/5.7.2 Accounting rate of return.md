# Accounting Rate of Return

## Formula 

### Average Rate of Return Method
- \[\text{Average Rate of Return} = \frac{\text{Average Annual Profit}}{\text{Net Investment in the Project}} \times 100 \]
- \[\text{Average Annual Profit} = \frac{\text{Total Profit After Depreciationn and After Tax}}{\text{Number of Years}} \]

### Return Per unit of Investment Method

- \[\text{Return Per unit of Investment} = \frac{\text{Total Profit After Depreciationn and After Taxes}}{\text{Net Investment in the project}} \times 100 \]

### Return on Average Investment Method

- \[\text{Return on Average Investment} = \frac{\text{Total Profit After Depreciationn and After Taxes}}{\text{Average Investment}} \times 100 \]

- \[\text{Average Investment} = \frac{\text{Initial Investment + Scrap Value}}{2} \], where Scrap Value is the value of the asset at the end of its useful life.

- \[\text{Average Investment} = \frac{\text{Initial Investment}}{2} \], where there is no Scrap Value.

- \[\text{Average Investment} = \frac{\text{Initial Investment + Salvage Value}}{2} + \text{Working Capital} + \text{Scrap Value} \]
