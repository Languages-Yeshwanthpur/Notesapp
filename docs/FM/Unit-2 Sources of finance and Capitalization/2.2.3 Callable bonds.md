# Callable Bonds

Callable bonds, also known as redeemable bonds, are a specific type of bond with the following features:

- **Early Redemption:** Callable bonds allow the issuer (usually a corporation or government entity) to redeem or "call" the bonds before the scheduled maturity date. This means they can pay off their debt obligation to bondholders earlier than expected.

- **Market Interest Rates:** Issuers typically exercise the call option when prevailing market interest rates are lower than the bond's coupon rate. By calling the bond, they can refinance at a more favorable interest rate, reducing their interest expenses.

- **Compensation for Call Risk:** Callable bonds usually offer a higher interest rate (coupon rate) compared to non-callable bonds to compensate investors for the risk that the issuer may call the bonds before maturity.

Investors in callable bonds should be aware of the issuer's right to call the bonds, as this may impact the expected returns and duration of their investment. Callable bonds are considered riskier than non-callable bonds, as the timing of the call can affect the bond's yield and the investor's overall return.
