# Zero Coupon Bonds/Zero Interest Bonds

Zero coupon bonds, also known as zero interest bonds, are unique debt instruments with the following characteristics:

- **Interest-Free:** Zero coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest (coupons) to bondholders during the life of the bond.

- **Deep Discount:** Investors purchase these bonds at a significant discount from their face value (par value or maturity value). The discount reflects the interest that would have been earned over time if the bond had paid periodic interest.

- **Face Value at Maturity:** The investor will receive the full face value of the bond when it matures. This face value is typically higher than the purchase price, representing the bond's return.

- **Maturity Date:** Zero coupon bonds have a predetermined maturity date when the issuer pays the bondholder the full face value. Until maturity, the bondholder receives no interest payments.

Investors in zero coupon bonds benefit from their ability to purchase bonds at a discount and receive the face value at maturity, resulting in a capital gain. These bonds are particularly attractive for long-term financial goals where compounding interest over time can significantly increase the investment's value.
