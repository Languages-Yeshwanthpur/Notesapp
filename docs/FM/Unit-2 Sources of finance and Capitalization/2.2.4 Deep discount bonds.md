# Deep Discount Bonds
A **deep-discount bond** is a type of bond that is sold in the market at a considerably lower value than its par or face value. Here are the key characteristics of deep-discount bonds:

- **Significant Discount:** Deep-discount bonds are typically sold at a discount of 20% or more below their par value. This means that investors can purchase these bonds for a fraction of their face value.

- **High Yield:** Due to the substantial discount at which they are sold, deep-discount bonds offer a significantly higher yield compared to prevailing interest rates on fixed-income securities with similar characteristics.

- **Credit Concerns:** The deep discount on these bonds may be an indication of underlying credit concerns or increased risk associated with the issuer. Investors demand a higher yield as compensation for the potential default risk.

- **Junk Level Rating:** As the risk of default increases with deep-discount bonds, they may be rated as junk or speculative-grade securities by credit rating agencies. These ratings indicate a higher level of credit risk.

Deep-discount bonds can be appealing to investors who are seeking higher yields but are willing to accept the associated credit risk. These bonds can provide an opportunity for investors to profit from price appreciation if the issuer's creditworthiness improves over time, leading to a potential increase in the bond's market price. However, they also come with a higher level of risk due to the possibility of issuer default.
