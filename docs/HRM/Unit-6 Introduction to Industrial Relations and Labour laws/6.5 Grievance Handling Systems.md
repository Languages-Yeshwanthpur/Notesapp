## Stage I: Initial Response

## Stage II: Departmental Review
- If unresolved, the issue escalates to a **supervisor**.
- The supervisor must make a decision within 3 days.

## Stage III: Departmental Head Intervention
- The next step involves the **Head of the Department**.
- Recommendations are to be made within 7 days.

## Stage IV: Management Review
- The grievance may then be brought to a **Grievance Committee** including **managerial** and **departmental representatives**.
- **Communication** of the committee's decision is due within 3 days.
- There is also an option for an **appeal to management** for a revision of the decision.

## Stage V: Final Arbitration
- Finally, there may be a **voluntary arbitration** or a **committee of union and management representatives**.
- The committee's decision can be referenced within 7 days after their decision.

The flowchart presents a structured approach to address employee grievances, offering multiple levels of escalation to ensure fair and thorough handling of issues. It reflects the organization's commitment to resolving disputes efficiently and effectively, adhering to specified timeframes at each stage.
