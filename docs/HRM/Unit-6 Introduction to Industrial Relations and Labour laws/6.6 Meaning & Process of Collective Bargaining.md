Collective bargaining is a process wherein employers and a group of employees negotiate the terms and conditions of employment. It aims to reach an agreement that addresses the needs and concerns of both parties.

## Negotiation Stage

The negotiation stage is a critical phase in collective bargaining. It involves discussing and resolving identified problems to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. The negotiation process can be broken down into the following steps:

### 1. Identification of Problem

- Before negotiations can begin, it's essential to identify the specific issues or concerns that need to be addressed.
    * This could involve wages, working conditions, benefits, or any other terms of employment.
    * Both parties should clearly outline their positions on these issues to ensure a productive discussion.

### 2. Preparing for Negotiation

- Preparation is crucial for a successful negotiation. This stage involves gathering information, formulating strategies, and setting clear objectives.
    * Research: Both parties should gather relevant data, such as industry standards, economic conditions, and past agreements, to make informed decisions.
    * Establishing a Negotiating Team: Each side should have a team of representatives who will participate in the negotiation. This team should be well-versed in the issues at hand and have the authority to make decisions.
    * Setting Objectives: Both parties should have a clear idea of what they aim to achieve through the negotiation. This could be in terms of wage increases, better working conditions, or other benefits.

### 3. Negotiation of Agreement

- This is the stage where both parties come together to discuss their concerns and try to reach a consensus.
    * Initial Proposals: Each side presents its initial proposals, outlining their demands and expectations.
    * Discussion and Deliberation: The negotiating teams engage in discussions, seeking common ground and working towards a solution that benefits both parties.
    * Reaching a Tentative Agreement: Once both sides have found a middle ground, they draft a tentative agreement that outlines the terms and conditions they've agreed upon.
    * Ratification: The tentative agreement is then presented to the larger body of employees for approval. If the majority of employees agree with the terms, the agreement is ratified and becomes binding.
