# Collective Bargaining

Collective bargaining is a process wherein employers and a group of employees negotiate the terms and conditions of employment. It aims to reach an agreement that addresses the needs and concerns of both parties.

## Negotiation Stage:

### 1. Identification of Problem
The first step in collective bargaining is identifying the problems or issues that need to be addressed. This involves both the union and management identifying their needs, concerns, and areas where they seek improvements or changes. Common issues include wages, working conditions, job security, benefits, and work hours.

### 2. Preparing for Negotiation
Preparation is key to effective bargaining. This involves gathering relevant data, formulating objectives, developing strategies, and deciding on negotiation tactics. Both parties typically prepare their proposals and demands. This stage also involves setting up a negotiation team with representatives who have the authority to make decisions and negotiate on behalf of their respective sides.


### 3. Negotiations of Agreement
This is the actual process of bargaining where union and management representatives meet to discuss their demands and proposals. The goal is to reach a mutual agreement that is acceptable to both parties. This process can involve a lot of back-and-forth discussions, compromises, and adjustments to proposals. Successful negotiations result in a draft agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of employment.

## Contract Administration

### 1. For Union and Management
Once an agreement is reached, it's crucial for both the union and management to effectively administer the contract. This means ensuring that the terms of the agreement are properly implemented and adhered to. It involves monitoring compliance, addressing any violations, and resolving disputes that may arise.

### 2. For the Management
From the management's perspective, contract administration involves integrating the agreed-upon terms into the company's policies and procedures. It requires educating management and supervisory staff about the contract's provisions to ensure consistent application and avoiding any unintentional breaches of the agreement.

### 3. For the Trade Union
For the union, contract administration includes ensuring that the rights and benefits won during negotiations are actually provided to the members. This may involve working with management to resolve any issues, representing members in grievances, and ensuring that the contract is being applied fairly and consistently.
