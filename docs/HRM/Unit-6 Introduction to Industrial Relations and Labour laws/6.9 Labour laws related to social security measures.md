1. **Unpaid Wages**: Labour laws require employers to pay for the work done by employees. If wages remain unpaid, workers can seek legal recourse to claim their due compensation.

2. **Leave and Holidays**: Laws typically mandate certain non-working days with pay, such as public holidays, and may also require employers to provide other types of leave, such as annual leave, sick leave, and parental leave.

3. **Gratuity**: A form of end-of-service benefit that is payable to employees who have completed a certain period of service with their employer. The actual conditions under which gratuity is paid and the amounts are governed by specific laws or regulations.

4. **Deductions**: Labour laws regulate the types of deductions that can be made from an employee's salary. This typically includes taxes, social security contributions, and other legally permitted deductions, ensuring that they are fair and not exploitative.

5. **Pension**: Many countries have statutory pension schemes to provide income to individuals upon retirement. Contributions may be made by both employers and employees, as dictated by relevant laws.

6. **Health Insurance**: Labour laws may require employers to provide health insurance or contribute to a national health service. The scope and scale of coverage can vary depending on the legal framework in place.

Each country's labour laws will detail the specific entitlements, contributions, and protections related to these social security measures. They are designed to provide a safety net for workers against exploitation and economic hardships associated with employment.
