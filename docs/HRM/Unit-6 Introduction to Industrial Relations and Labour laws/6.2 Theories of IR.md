# Dunlop Theory of Industrial Relations

The **Dunlop theory of industrial relations** posits that the industrial system is made up of three distinct parts: 
- Management organizations
- Workers 
- Government agencies. 

These three entities do not operate in isolation. Instead, they are interconnected, with the influence of each being influenced by its position within the market and political spheres. This perspective was introduced by sociologist **John Dunlop** in 1958.

## Key Components of Dunlopâ€™s Theory

Dunlop's theory fundamentally views the industrial relations system as a social subsystem. The interactions within this subsystem are influenced by three primary factors:
1. **Technology**
2. **Economy**
3. **Distribution of political power**

The interplay of these environmental factors and the ensuing rules shape the relationship between employers and workers in an industrial setting.

## Comparison with Other Theories

Unlike dominant theories of his era that saw employers, workers, and the government as separate entities with distinct powers and mechanisms, Dunlop portrayed the entire industrial relationship as an intricate system. Within this system, each component is intertwined and interdependent. Dunlop emphasized the external forces that determine the roles of each principal player. Hence, management, the workforce, and technology exist within the overarching societal framework and are influenced by legal, political, social, and economic forces.
