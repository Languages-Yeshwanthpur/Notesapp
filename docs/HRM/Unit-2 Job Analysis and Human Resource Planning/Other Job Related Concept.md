## **Job Enrichment:**

**Job Enrichment** means redesigning jobs in a way that increases
the opportunities for the worker to experience feelings of responsibility, achievement, growth,
and recognition—and therefore more motivation. It does this by empowering the worker—for
instance, by giving the worker the skills and authority to inspect the work, instead of having
supervisors do that. A simple example of enrichment is to allow a front-office receptionist to be
responsible for activities like travel management, or basic customer relationship management
activities. Empowerment, in this context, implies that the individual is made responsible for
providing service as well as other dimensions like cost reduction and customer satisfaction.
Herzberg said empowered employees would do their jobs well because they wanted to, and
quality and productivity would rise. That philosophy, in one form or another, is the theoretical
basis for the team-based self-managmg jobs in many companies around the world today.

## Job enlargement and Job rotation:
**Job enlargement** means assigning workers additional
same-level activities. Thus, the worker who previously only bolted the seat to the legs might
attach the back too. Job rotation means systematically moving workers from one job to
another. In Indian public sector banks, it's mandatory that branch level clerical employees are
rotated between jobs every' six months.
**Job rotation** helps the employees to develop new skills
and attitudes. It also reduces work monotony. Additionally its also a risk management
mechanism. Thus, the bank is able to develop motivated and multi-skilled employees.


**Flexi Timing:**
Flexi timing, short for flexible timing, is a work arrangement that allows employees to choose their start and end times within a specified range. This approach recognizes that different employees have varying personal commitments and peak productivity times. Flexi timing promotes work-life balance and can lead to higher job satisfaction and employee morale. However, it usually requires clear communication and coordination to ensure that team collaboration and business operations are not disrupted.
