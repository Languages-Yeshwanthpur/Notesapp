# Results Methods of Performance Appraisals

Results methods of performance appraisal focus on the outcomes or results achieved by employees rather than the behaviors or traits exhibited during job performance. These methods are often preferred for their objectivity and clarity. Below are the details of some results methods of performance appraisals:

## 1. **Management By Objectives (MBO):**
   - MBO is a systematic and organized approach that allows management to focus on achievable goals and to attain the best possible results from available resources.
   - It involves setting clear, specific, and measurable objectives collaboratively by the managers and the employees, and then reviewing the employees' performance against these objectives.
   - This method promotes clarity, objectivity, and constructive feedback.

## 2. **Balanced Scorecard:**
   - The Balanced Scorecard method evaluates employee performance against a range of performance indicators across four perspectives: financial, customer, internal processes, and learning & growth.
   - It provides a holistic view of the organization's performance and allows for a balanced evaluation of employee contributions across multiple dimensions.
   - This method aligns employees' performance metrics with the strategic goals and values of the organization.

## 3. **Human Resource Accounting:**
   - Human Resource Accounting involves quantifying the cost and value of employees to the organization.
   - This method considers the investment made in employees and the future economic benefits that the organization can derive from them.
   - By putting a financial value on human resources, organizations can better understand the return on their investment in their workforce.

## 4. **Productivity Measures:**
   - Productivity measures focus on the ratio of output produced to the input used. In a performance appraisal context, it involves measuring the amount of work or output produced by an employee against the resources used.
   - It's a straightforward method to assess an employee's efficiency and effectiveness.
   - Productivity measures can be particularly useful in roles where output can be easily quantified, such as manufacturing or sales.

Each of these results methods provides a different perspective on evaluating employee performance. They shift the focus from subjective traits or behaviors to objective results and outcomes, which can provide a clearer and more accurate picture of an employee's contributions to the organization. However, these methods may overlook the qualitative aspects of job performance, and may not fully capture an employee's potential or the challenges faced in achieving results. Therefore, a combination of results methods and behavioral or trait methods might be used to achieve a more holistic appraisal of employee performance.
