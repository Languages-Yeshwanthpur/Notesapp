## Fund Based Financial Services

Fund based financial services are centered around the provision and management of funds. Financial institutions engage in lending activities, where they provide funds to individuals or entities and earn interest on the lent amount over a specified tenure. Here are several types of fund-based financial services:

1. **Loans and Advances:**
       * Institutions extend loans and advances to individuals, businesses, and other entities for various purposes such as purchasing property, financing business operations, or addressing urgent financial needs.
       * Example: Banks providing home loans, personal loans, or business loans at a specific rate of interest for a defined period.

2. **Credit Services:**
       * Credit services encompass facilities like overdrafts, credit cards, or lines of credit, enabling customers to access funds up to a certain limit.
       * Example: A bank offering credit card services with a specified credit limit, allowing customers to make purchases and pay back at a later date.

3. **Leasing:**
       * Leasing is a contractual arrangement where assets are provided to clients for use over a specified period in return for periodic lease payments.
       * Example: Companies leasing vehicles or equipment from financial institutions, making periodic payments as per the lease agreement.

4. **Hire Purchase:**
       * In a hire purchase agreement, customers can purchase assets by making an initial down payment followed by subsequent periodic payments.

       * Financial advisory services offer investment advice, financial planning, retirement planning, and other financial consultancy services to individuals and businesses.
       * Example: Financial advisors providing personalized investment advice to clients for a fee.

       * Example: Financial institutions providing underwriting services for public stock or bond offerings, ensuring the successful sale of securities.

In conclusion, fund-based and fee-based financial services cater to the diverse financial needs of individuals and businesses. While fund-based services focus on the provision of funds and financing, fee-based services offer expertise, advisory, and other financial services for a fee. Financial institutions often provide a blend of both fund-based and fee-based services, enabling them to offer a comprehensive range of financial solutions to their clients.
