# The World Bank

The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides loans to developing countries for capital programs. It was founded in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference and is headquartered in Washington, D.C. The World Bank's official goal is the reduction of poverty. According to the World Bank's Articles of Agreement (as amended effective 16 February 1989), all its decisions must be guided by a commitment to promote foreign investment, international trade, and facilitate capital investment.

The World Bank consists of two institutions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). The IBRD provides loans to middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries, while the IDA provides grants and loans to the poorest countries.

The World Bank's lending is subject to a number of conditions, including:

- The country must have a sound economic policy.
- The country must be committed to reducing poverty.
- The country must be willing to implement reforms to its economic policies.

The World Bank has been criticized for its lending practices. Critics argue that the World Bank's loans have often been used to support corrupt governments and that they have not always been effective in reducing poverty. The World Bank has also been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability.

Despite these criticisms, the World Bank remains an important player in the global economy. It provides loans to countries that are trying to develop their economies and it helps to promote economic growth. The World Bank also provides technical assistance to countries on a wide range of development issues.
