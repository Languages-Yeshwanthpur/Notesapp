# Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), Gujral Doctrine, and Act East Policy

## Non-Aligned Movement (NAM):
The Non-Aligned Movement emerged during the Cold War aiming to establish a middle path for states in the international community by staying neutral and not aligning with either of the major power blocs. The core principles of NAM are:

1. **Sovereignty:** Upholding the sovereignty of nations and advocating for non-intervention in the internal affairs of states.
2. **Non-Aggression:** Promoting peaceful relations and abstaining from acts of aggression towards other states.
3. **Mutual Non-Interference:** Encouraging states to refrain from interfering in the internal matters of other nations.
4. **Equality:** Advocating for equal rights and opportunities for all nations.
5. **Peaceful Co-Existence:** Encouraging nations to live together in peace and harmony.

## Gujral Doctrine:
The Gujral Doctrine is named after former Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, aimed at maintaining peaceful relations and fostering goodwill among India and its neighbors. The principles are:

1. **Do Not Ask for Reciprocity:** Engaging in non-reciprocal goodwill without expecting similar concessions in return.
2. **Non-Interference in Others' Domestic Affairs:** Respecting the sovereignty of other countries and refraining from interference.
3. **No Country Shall Use Its Territory Against Others:** Ensuring territories are not used for activities harmful to neighboring countries.
4. **Respect Sovereignty:** Upholding and respecting the sovereignty, integrity, and political independence of all nations.
5. **Peaceful Bilateral Negotiations to Settle Disputes:** Encouraging peaceful bilateral negotiations for dispute resolution.

## Act East Policy:
The Act East Policy is an initiative by India to bolster its ties with the countries of the Indo-Pacific region, focusing particularly on the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region. It is an expansion of the earlier "Look East Policy" with a broader geographical and strategic scope. The key components include:

1. **Political Engagement:** Enhancing political relations and engagements with countries in the Indo-Pacific region.
2. **Economic Integration:** Fostering economic integration through trade agreements, investments, and other economic linkages.
3. **Security Cooperation:** Enhancing security cooperation to address traditional and non-traditional security challenges.
4. **Cultural and Academic Exchanges:** Promoting cultural exchanges and academic collaborations to foster mutual understanding and goodwill.
5. **Regional Institutional Building:** Engaging in regional institutions and forums to contribute to regional governance and cooperation.

The Act East Policy, like NAM and the Gujral Doctrine, reflects India's strategic approach towards fostering peaceful and cooperative relations, both regionally and globally, emphasizing the principles of mutual respect, sovereignty, and peaceful coexistence. Through these frameworks, India aims to enhance its diplomatic engagements, security cooperation, and economic integration with its neighbors and beyond, contributing to regional stability and global peace.
