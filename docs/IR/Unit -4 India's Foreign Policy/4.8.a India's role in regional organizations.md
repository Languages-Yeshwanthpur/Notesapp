# India's Role in regional organizations

## South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)

South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic and geopolitical organization of eight countries that are primarily located in South Asia or the Indian subcontinent. The SAARC Secretariat is based in Kathmandu, Nepal. The combined economy of SAARC is the third largest in the world in the terms of GDP (PPP) after the United States and China and fifth largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP. SAARC nations comprise 3% of the world's area, 21% of the world's population and 4.21% (US$3.67 trillion) of the global economy, as of 2019.

### Failure of SAARC

SAARC has failed to live up to its promise. The reasons for this are:

The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has encountered numerous obstacles that have hindered its progress and effectiveness. Among these challenges are:

1. **India-Pakistan Rivalry**: This longstanding conflict often overshadows regional cooperation within SAARC. For instance, the cancellation of the 19th SAARC Summit in 2016 due to India's withdrawal in response to the Uri terrorist attack highlights how bilateral tensions can disrupt SAARC's activities.

2. **Bilateral Disputes**: Disputes between other member countries, like the Indo-Nepal border disputes and historical tensions between Sri Lanka and India, have negatively impacted the cooperative environment within SAARC.

3. **Lack of Trust and Confidence**: Historical mistrust and unresolved conflicts among member states, such as between India and Nepal, have limited cooperation and led to diplomatic tensions.

4. **Non-Cooperation by Member States**: Some members have been reluctant to fully engage in SAARC initiatives. Bhutan's hesitance to join certain activities due to its concerns about China is an example of this.

5. **Security Concerns**: Issues like terrorism and insurgency, notably the cross-border terrorism between India and Pakistan, have strained relations and impeded collective efforts to address these challenges within the region.

6. **Asymmetry in Economic Power**: The economic dominance of India in SAARC has raised concerns among smaller member states about potential overshadowing and imbalanced benefits, affecting their enthusiasm for regional economic cooperation.

7. **Lack of Progress in Key Agreements**: Agreements like the SAARC Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) have not been fully realized, partly due to non-tariff barriers and a lack of trust among member states.

8. **Geostrategic Competition**: The involvement of external powers such as China and the United States has introduced additional complexity and potential rivalry, affecting the regional dynamics.

These issues collectively contribute to SAARC's limited success in achieving its goals of regional cooperation and peace-building. The organization faces a challenging road ahead in addressing these diverse and deep-rooted problems.
