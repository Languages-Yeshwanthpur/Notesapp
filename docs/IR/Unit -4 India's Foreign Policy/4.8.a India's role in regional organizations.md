# India's Role in regional organizations

## South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)

South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic and geopolitical organization of eight countries that are primarily located in South Asia or the Indian subcontinent. The SAARC Secretariat is based in Kathmandu, Nepal. The combined economy of SAARC is the third largest in the world in the terms of GDP (PPP) after the United States and China and fifth largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP. SAARC nations comprise 3% of the world's area, 21% of the world's population and 4.21% (US$3.67 trillion) of the global economy, as of 2019.

### Failure of SAARC

SAARC has failed to live up to its promise. The reasons for this are:

- **India-Pakistan rivalry:** The rivalry between India and Pakistan has been a major obstacle to SAARC's progress. The two countries have fought three wars since 1947, and their relations have been strained for decades. This has prevented SAARC from functioning effectively as an organization.

- **Lack of political will:** SAARC has been plagued by a lack of political will among its member states. Many leaders have been reluctant to make the necessary compromises for SAARC to succeed.


- **Lack of economic integration:** SAARC has failed to achieve meaningful economic integration among its member states. This is due to a lack of political will and the absence of a common currency.

- **Lack of institutional capacity:** SAARC has been unable to develop the institutional capacity necessary for it to function effectively. This is due to a lack of political will and the absence of a common currency.

- **Lack of Trust and Confidence:** SAARC has been unable to develop the trust and confidence necessary for it to function effectively. This is due to a lack of political will and the absence of a common currency.


- **Lack of leadership:** SAARC has been unable to develop the leadership necessary for it to function effectively. This is due to a lack of political will and the absence of a common currency.

- **Lack of resources:** SAARC has been unable to develop the resources necessary for it to function effectively. This is due to a lack of political will and the absence of a common currency.
